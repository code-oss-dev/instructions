Code Analyzes and Reports

## This is the Open Source Development
Documentation of a Editor once called Monaco was a Project of a small Team inside microsoft i am not sure where they copyed from
i guess it was ace editor but i am not 100% sure as of point in time. 

## The main value of this
- is to create a new History of Open Source Editors. 
- Also this has the goal to identify if even any single commit of over 100k made any sense it does look like
- they only spinned around build scripts at present.
